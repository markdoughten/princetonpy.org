    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>We're a group for all things Python, open-source and STEM.</p>
    <p>Whether you've never programmed, or have been programming for a long time - please join us!</p>
    <p>We're always looking for people for presentations, so if you have something you'd like to talk about, please let us know!</p>
    <p>Tell us in advance, and we can announce the topic beforehand, otherwise we always have an open floor for discussion.</p>
    <p>There really isn't a high bar to participate; this is great space to bring up things like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>projects (we like to hear about works-in-progress too)</li>
        <li>code snippets & language feature examples</li>
        <li>a problem you're stumped by</li>
        <li>an interesting library</li>
    </ul>
