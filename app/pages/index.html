<h1>Princeton Python User Group</h1>
<section>
<h2>Who we are:</h2>
<p>We're a group that meets on the second Monday of every month, usually around 7-8:30pm.</p>
<p>Whether you've never programmed, or have been programming for a long time - please join us!</p>
<p>The group is obviously Python-centric, but anything in the realm of open-source and programming is fair game too.</p>
<p>We're always looking for people to present, so if you have something you'd like to talk about, please let us
    know!</p>
<p>Tell us in advance and we can announce the topic beforehand, otherwise we always have an open floor for
    discussion.</p>
<p>There really isn't a high bar to participate; this is great space to bring up things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a project you've been working on</li>
  <li>a problem you're stumped by</li>
  <li>even something as simple as an interesting new library you've come across</li>
</ul>
